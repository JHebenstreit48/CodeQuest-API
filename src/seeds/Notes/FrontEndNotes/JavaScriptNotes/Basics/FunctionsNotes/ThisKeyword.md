## Understanding "this" in JavaScript

---

### Overview

The this keyword is one of the most misunderstood concepts in JavaScript.  
It does **not** behave like this in other object-oriented languages — in JavaScript, its value depends entirely on **how a function is called**, not where it’s defined.

✅ this refers to the object that is currently executing the function.  
❗ The value of this is **dynamic** unless an arrow function or manual binding is used.

---

### Global Context

When used in the global scope (outside any function or object), this refers to the **global object**.

- In browsers: this → window  
- In Node.js: this → {} (or global in some contexts)

```javascript
console.log(this); // In browser: Window object

function globalFn() {
  console.log(this); // Still Window in non-strict mode
}

globalFn();
```

---

### Function Context

When a function is called in a standard way, this refers to the **global object** (non-strict mode) or undefined (strict mode).

```javascript
function show() {
  console.log(this);
}

show(); // Window or undefined depending on strict mode
```

---

### Object Method Context

When a function is called as a method of an object, this refers to that object.

```javascript
const dog = {
  name: "Rex",
  bark: function () {
    console.log("Woof! My name is " + this.name);
  }
};

dog.bark(); // "Woof! My name is Rex"
```

### Arrow Functions and Lexical this

Arrow functions do **not** bind their own this.  
Instead, they inherit this from the **surrounding (lexical) scope**.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Nina",
  sayName: () => {
    console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.name);
  }
};

person.sayName(); // "Hi, I'm undefined" — because this is not the person object
```

Compare that with a normal method:

```javascript
const person2 = {
  name: "Liam",
  sayName: function () {
    console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.name);
  }
};

person2.sayName(); // "Hi, I'm Liam"
```

### Event Handlers and this

In DOM event handlers, this usually refers to the element that triggered the event — unless an arrow function is used.

```javascript
document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log(this); // the button element
});

document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log(this); // likely the window or surrounding lexical scope
});
```
---

### Manually Binding this: call(), apply(), bind()

You can control what this refers to using these built-in methods:

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
}

const user = { name: "Zara" };

greet.call(user);  // Immediate call with user as this
greet.apply(user); // Same as call, but with arguments as an array
const greetUser = greet.bind(user);
greetUser();       // Bound to user permanently
```

---

### this in Constructor Functions and Classes

When using constructors or ES6 classes, this refers to the **instance** being created.

```javascript
function Car(make) {
  this.make = make;
  console.log("Car created:", this.make);
}

const honda = new Car("Honda"); // this.make = "Honda"

class Animal {
  constructor(type) {
    this.type = type;
  }
  speak() {
    console.log("This animal is a " + this.type);
  }
}

const cat = new Animal("cat");
cat.speak(); // "This animal is a cat"
```

### Summary Table: this Keyword Behavior

<table class="notesTable">
  <thead>
    <tr class="tableHeader">
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Where/How Used</th>
      <th class="tableCellHeader">What this Refers To</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Global Scope</td>
      <td class="tableCell">window (browser) or global (Node)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">

      <td class="tableCell">undefined (strict) or window (non-strict)</td>
    </tr>

    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Arrow Function</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Lexical scope (inherits from parent)</td>
    </tr>
