## History of JavaScript

---

### The Birth of JavaScript

In 1995, <span class="emphasis">Brendan Eich</span> created the first version of JavaScript while working at <span class="emphasis">Netscape Communications</span>.  
The goal was to develop a lightweight scripting language that could run inside web browsers and enable greater user interactivity.

- JavaScript was originally called <span class="emphasis">Mocha</span> during early development.
- It was briefly renamed <span class="emphasis">LiveScript</span> before finally being released as <span class="emphasis">JavaScript</span> to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.
- Despite the name, JavaScript and Java are fundamentally different languages with different purposes.

### Early Adoption and Standardization

As JavaScript grew in popularity, inconsistencies appeared between browser implementations.  
To solve this, JavaScript was standardized under the name <span class="emphasis">ECMAScript</span> by <span class="emphasis">ECMA International</span>.

- The first standard, <span class="secondEmphasis">ECMAScript 1</span>, was published in 1997.
- Over time, major updates like <span class="secondEmphasis">ES5</span> (2009) and <span class="secondEmphasis">ES6 (ES2015)</span> added powerful new features, including classes, modules, arrow functions, and promises.

### JavaScript's Growth Beyond the Browser

Originally, JavaScript was confined to client-side scripting inside browsers.  
However, with the creation of <span class="emphasis">Node.js</span> in 2009, JavaScript expanded to server-side development as well.

- <span class="emphasis">Node.js</span> uses the <span class="emphasis">V8 JavaScript engine</span> (originally built for Google Chrome).
- This innovation enabled JavaScript to build full-stack applications, APIs, and even real-time applications like chat servers.

### JavaScript Today

✅ JavaScript remains the dominant language for web development.  
✅ It forms the "holy trinity" of front-end technologies: <span class="secondEmphasis">HTML</span>, <span class="secondEmphasis">CSS</span>, and <span class="secondEmphasis">JavaScript</span>.  
✅ Modern frameworks and libraries like <span class="emphasis">React</span>, <span class="emphasis">Angular</span>, and <span class="emphasis">Vue.js</span> have further propelled its growth.  
✅ JavaScript now powers client-side interfaces, server-side APIs, mobile apps, desktop apps, and even IoT devices.
