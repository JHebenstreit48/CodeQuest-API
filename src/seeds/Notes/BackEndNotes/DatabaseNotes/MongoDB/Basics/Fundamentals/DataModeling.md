### Data Modeling in MongoDB
---

MongoDB favors **flexible**, **document-based** models over rigid tables. Documents in the same collection can vary in fields and types.

---
### Collections
---

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

ðŸ”¹ Collections â‰ˆ SQL tables (conceptually), but with **no enforced schema**  
ðŸ”¹ Documents can have different keys and types  
ðŸ”¹ Related data often lives as **embedded** objects/arrays rather than separate tables  

</div>

---
### Related Data: Embed vs Reference
---

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">Embed</span> when data is accessed together frequently (read-optimized, one-to-few)  
ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">Reference</span> when data is shared broadly, large, or independent  
ðŸ”¹ Arrays of embedded documents are common for tightly coupled sub-entities  

</div>

---
### One-to-One Relationships (Basics)
---

A one-to-one can be modeled by:

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">Embedding</span> the child subdocument directly  
ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">Referencing</span> the child via its <span class="emphasis">ObjectId</span> field (values must match; field names donâ€™t need to)  

</div>
