### REST vs GraphQL vs SOAP
---

These are three major API paradigms:

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">REST</span> â†’ resource-based, relies on HTTP verbs  
ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">GraphQL</span> â†’ query language, client specifies shape of data  
ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">SOAP</span> â†’ XML-based protocol, strict standards, often enterprise  

</div>

Each has different tradeoffs in flexibility, performance, and complexity.
