# Session vs Token Authentication

When building web apps, two popular ways to manage logged-in users are **session-based** and **token-based** authentication. Each has unique benefits depending on app architecture and user needs.

---

## ðŸ”’ Session-Based Authentication

- The server creates and stores a **session** after successful login.
- A **session ID** is sent to the client via an HTTP-only cookie.
- On each request, the browser sends the cookie, and the server retrieves the session data using that ID.

**Key traits:**
- Requires **server-side memory** or database for active sessions.
- Easy to revoke (logout = delete session).
- Commonly used in traditional multi-page applications.

## ðŸ”‘ Token-Based Authentication

- The server issues a **signed token** (e.g., JWT) to the client after login.
- The token is stored client-side (in localStorage, cookies, etc.).
- Every request includes the token in the header â€” usually as a Bearer token.

**Key traits:**
- **Stateless**: no server-side session storage.
- Harder to revoke once issued.
- Common in SPAs, mobile apps, and public APIs.

## ðŸ§  Which One Should You Use?

Use **sessions** when:
- You need easy revocation (e.g., forced logout)
- Youâ€™re building a traditional server-rendered web app
- Your app is not heavily API-driven

Use **tokens** when:
- You're working with APIs or microservices
- You want stateless authentication for better scalability
- You're building a mobile app or SPA

---

## âœ… Summary

- **Session-based authentication** stores user data on the server; great for apps that need tighter server control.
- **Token-based authentication** stores data client-side; great for distributed systems and APIs.
- Consider a **hybrid approach** (e.g., use JWTs for API access, but manage them via short-lived session cookies for better security).
