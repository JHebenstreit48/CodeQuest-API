# TypeScript Basics

## Overview
---

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other advanced features to the language. It enables developers to catch errors at compile time, improve code maintainability, and build scalable applications.

---

## Key Features
---

- **Static Typing:** Allows developers to define variable types explicitly, reducing runtime errors.
- **Type Inference:** Automatically infers types when not explicitly declared, providing flexibility.
- **Advanced Tooling:** Improves the developer experience with features like IntelliSense and autocompletion.
- **Compatibility:** Fully interoperable with JavaScript, making it easy to adopt in existing projects.
- **Scalability:** Simplifies working with large codebases by enforcing consistent type definitions.

## Benefits of Using TypeScript
---

- **Error Detection:** Identifies potential issues during development instead of at runtime.
- **Code Readability:** Enhances the clarity and self-documenting nature of code.
- **Better Collaboration:** Ensures consistency and reduces misunderstandings in team environments.
- **Future-Proofing:** Aligns well with modern JavaScript standards and features.
