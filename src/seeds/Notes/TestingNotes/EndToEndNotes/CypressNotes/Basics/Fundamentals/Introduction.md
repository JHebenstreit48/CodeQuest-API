## What Is Cypress?

Cypress is a modern, end-to-end testing framework built for the modern web.

âœ… It runs directly in the browser alongside your application  
âœ… Designed for <span class="codeSnip">JavaScript</span>/<span class="codeSnip">TypeScript</span> developers  
âœ… Ideal for testing modern front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Angular

## Why Use Cypress?

- ðŸ”¹ Fast feedback loop with hot reloading of tests  
- ðŸ”¹ Runs in the same run-loop as the app â€” gives better visibility  
- ðŸ”¹ Uses a real browser â€” no WebDriver layer required  
- ðŸ”¹ Built-in wait, retry, and assertion handling  
- ðŸ”¹ Friendly debugging with time-travel snapshots and error messages  
- ðŸ”¹ Excellent integration with CI tools like GitHub Actions and CircleCI

## Cypress Mental Model

Tests in Cypress are written in a way that feels like **instructions in a sentence**.  
Each test block reads like a simple command:

<table class="notesTable">
  <thead>
    <tr class="tableHeader">
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Cypress Command</th>
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Analogy</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell"><span class="codeSnip">cy.visit()</span></td>
      <td class="tableCell">Go to this place</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell"><span class="codeSnip">cy.get()</span></td>
      <td class="tableCell">Find this thing</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell"><span class="codeSnip">cy.contains()</span></td>
      <td class="tableCell">Look for this text</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell"><span class="codeSnip">cy.click()</span></td>
      <td class="tableCell">Click this</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell"><span class="codeSnip">cy.should()</span></td>
      <td class="tableCell">Verify it behaves like this</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Cypress Test Structure Analogy

ðŸ§  Think of a Cypress file like a **scripted sentence**:

- <span class="codeSnip">describe()</span> = "This is the topic we're testing"  
- <span class="codeSnip">it()</span> = "This specific thing should happen"  
- Inside each <span class="codeSnip">it()</span>:  
  - <span class="codeSnip">cy.visit()</span> = "Go to this place"  
  - <span class="codeSnip">cy.get()</span> = "Find this thing"  
  - <span class="codeSnip">cy.contains()</span> = "Look for this text"  
  - <span class="codeSnip">cy.click()</span> = "Click this"  
  - <span class="codeSnip">cy.should()</span> = "Verify it behaves like this"

This style makes Cypress easy to read, easy to write, and easy to teach.
